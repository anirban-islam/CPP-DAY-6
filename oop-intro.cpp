    //OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
    //Object-oriented programming is about creating "objects", which can hold data and functions that work on that data.
    //Advantages of OOP
        //OOP provides a clear structure to programs
        //Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
        //Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
        //Makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
    //What are Classes and Objects?
    //Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
    //A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class. For example:

    //Class	                Objects
    //Fruit	            Apple, Banana, Mango
    //Car	            Volvo, Audi, Toyota

    //When you create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.
    //In the next chapters, you will learn how to:

    //Define a class
    //Create objects
    //Access class members
    //And much more
    //Procedural programming is about writing functions that operate on data.
    //Object-oriented programming (OOP) is about creating objects that contain both the data and the functions.
    //In procedural programming, the code is organized around functions.
    //In object-oriented programming, the code is organized around objects.
